 ## Tests
 Run test_case_generation.py to generate test cases. The cases will be saved in the tests/cases folder, but not committed to the repo.
 Test case files will be named as art_exhibition_n{number of paintings}_{number of platforms}.txt and have the format:
 ```
 n W
 w1 h1
 w2 h2
 ...
 wn hn
 ```
